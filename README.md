This is a simple Etch-a-Sketch project that is fully playable.

It consists of a number of squares in a square grid, when the mouse moves over a square, the square is filled in.

The number of squares can be determined by the user from 1x1 to 100x100.

The project provided by The Odin Project, and is a way to practice my skills with things including flexbox and DOM manipulation.

I also took this as an opporunity to practice some extra things:
 - using closure to avoid the use of global variables.
 - extracting bits of code into separate functions to improve
    code readability.
