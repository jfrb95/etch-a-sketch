This is a simple Etch-a-Sketch project that is fully playable.

It consists of a number of squares in a square grid, when the mouse moves over a square, the square is filled in.

The number of squares can be determined by the user from 1x1 to 100x100.

The project was provided by The Odin Project, and is a way to practice my skills with things including:
 - flexbox.
 - DOM manipulation.
 - event handling.

I also took this as an opporunity to practice some extra things:
 - using closure to avoid the use of global variables.
 - extracting bits of code into separate functions to improve
    code readability.

The Rainbow and Shader modes are an extra part added, not a necessary one. The current implementation keeps each mode separate. If I revisit this, I will turn the shader mode into an additional system where it darkens whatever color the square already is, and doesnt affect the color at all.
