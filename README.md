This is a simple Etch-a-Sketch project that is fully playable.

It consists of a number of squares in a square grid, when the mouse moves over a square, the square is filled in.

The number of squares can be determined by the user from 1x1 to 100x100.

The project is a way to practice my skill with flexbox, DOM manipulation, and some other things.
